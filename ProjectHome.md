Nasa's International Space Apps Challenge:

http://spaceappschallenge.org/challenge/catch-a-meteor-tracker/

Background:

Each year, millions of observable, unexpected meteors encounter the Earth's atmosphere and become a spectacle to the population below.  Many of the brighter "shooting stars" actually reach the surface of the Earth, becoming "meteorites", encapsulating secrets of our universe in their charred remains.

The meteor that fell over Chelyabinsk in February of this year produced meteorites with a mass of over 1 kg. Most meteorites, however, are very small and often break into even smaller pieces before landing in remote areas, hiding in plain sight as the moisture of Earth's atmosphere degrades them.

Challenge Description:

Educate the interested public about the science of Near-Earth Objects (NEOs), the likelihood of encounters with objects of various sizes, and the discoveries that are made by studying these rocky visitors to our planet.

Functional Specifications:

Enhance education on the subject of NEOs through visualizations, games, social media, and the building of an online community.

Techniques to observe with more accuracy, precision, or even with different methods (like building a radio receiver to "hear" the meteor as it encounters the ionosphere), could be shared by this community and enable it to be self-sustainable.

Look at meteor-tracking apps like those listed below and design something similar, but with an educational spin on it.
